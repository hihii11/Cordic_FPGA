Net Cordic_i/Roate_keyv2_0/inst/Roate_keyv2_v1_0_S0_AXI_inst/KEY/C0/slv_reg0_reg[0]_93 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Cordic_i/Roate_keyv2_0/inst/Roate_keyv2_v1_0_S0_AXI_inst/KEY/C0/data_reg[0]_LDC_i_1/O, cell Cordic_i/Roate_keyv2_0/inst/Roate_keyv2_v1_0_S0_AXI_inst/KEY/C0/data_reg[0]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#33 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net Cordic_i/key_shake_0/inst/key_out is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Cordic_i/key_shake_0/inst/key_out__0/O, cell Cordic_i/key_shake_0/inst/key_out__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
